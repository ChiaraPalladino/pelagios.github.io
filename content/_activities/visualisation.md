The purpose of the Visualisation Activity is to support developers and end-users in conceptualising and developing methods and tools for:
- **visualisation**, such as showing the geographic scope of a dataset, or representing a spatial network;
- **discovery**, including the search and retrieval of data from across the collective of Partners, using filters that include period, data type, geographic location, and source; and
- **analysis**, by leveraging the outcome of linked data to stimulate new research questions and provide new insights.
