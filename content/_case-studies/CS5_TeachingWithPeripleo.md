Linked Open Data is a powerful tool for navigating through the complexity of the inherently multifaceted reality of archaeological sites,
which results from the intersections of space, materiality, language, visual culture, history, text, and so on.
However, LOD also poses the challenge of how to manage such complexity in a meaningful way.
In this post, Chiara Palladino <a href="https://medium.com/pelagios/linked-open-data-to-navigate-the-past-using-peripleo-in-class-4286b3089bf3">reports</a> on an experimental project developed during a Classical Archaeology course in 2018 at Furman University, 
where students researched four different Graeco-Roman sites, with the goal of reconstructing the main aspects of their material history
through exclusively LOD-based resources.
