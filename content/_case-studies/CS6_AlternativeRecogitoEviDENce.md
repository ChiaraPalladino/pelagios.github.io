In the EviDENce project, researchers at the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences Humanities Cluster’s Digital Humanities Lab 
work with historians and eScience engineers to investigate how the perception of the concept of ‘violence’ changes over time through 
eyewitness reports and ego-documents (ego documents are texts in which the personal life and experiences of the author play an important 
and central role such as diaries, autobiographies and memoirs). In the first year of the project, they focused on transcribed WWII 
eyewitness interviews and we investigated how suitable state-of-the-art language technology pipelines are for the purposes of extracting 
relevant information from these interview texts. Read more about the project <a href="https://pro.europeana.eu/page/issue-12-pelagios#alternative-uses-of-recogito">here</a>
