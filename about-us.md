The Pelagios Network is a long-running initiative that links information online through common references to places. 
To create and maintain these connections, Pelagios has developed: 
- a method for creating semantic annotations, based on the W3C Web Annotation standard;
- tools and specifications for creating and making use of these annotations, most notably Recogito, an open-source platform for geo-annotating texts, images and databases;
- a community of individuals and organizations working with geographic data in humanities disciplines (history, language and literary studies, archaeology, etc.), and cultural heritage (galleries, libraries, archives and museums).

### How does it work?
In order to sustain and further develop work in this area, the Pelagios Network focuses on six core Activities, which are: 
- Annotation
- Collaboration
- Gazetteer
- Pedagogy
- Registry
- Visualisation

### How can I get involved?
Pelagios is a formal network of equal and independent Partners who coordinate their work together, and a wider community of Members who have an interest in the Network and its activities. Partners may nominate Representatives who can then have a say in the coordination of an Activity, and can become an Activity Lead. 

- To become a Partner, individuals and institutions can jointly agree a set of contributions to one or more of the Activities with the Networkâ€™s governing Committee, formalised through a Memorandum of Understanding*;
- To become a Member, simply sign up to the Discussion list.

*_MoUs are voluntary, there are no fees or subscriptions, and Partners remain in full control of their own work plans and resources_.
