Pelagios is a long-running initiative that links geographic information in the humanities.
Its gradual evolution and broad range of activities can sometimes be confusing for newcomers (and even for us!).
This document is intended to offer a basic overview for anyone.

#### What is Pelagios?
Pelagios (or to give it its full title, The Pelagios Network) is a Social Infrastructure for Linked Open Geodata in the
Humanities and Cultural Heritage.

#### What does that mean?
Linked Open Data (LOD) is the goal of linking together related online data resources.
While it is possible and useful to link together data held on a single computer, or within a single organisation, the unique value of
Linked Open Data is its ability to connect data that are heterogeneous (i.e. differently structured or formatted) and independently
maintained. To create and maintain these connections requires agreed methodologies, user-friendly tools and a community of practice.

Pelagios restricts its scope to the geographic aspects of data, and semantic annotation - i.e. associating every reference to a place within
the data to an entry in a globally accessible gazetteer - as a mechanism for achieving it.
Pelagios provides:
1. a method for creating semantic annotations, based on the W3C Web Annotation standard;
2. tools and specifications for creating and making use of these annotations, most notably Recogito, an open-source platform for geo-annotating texts, images and databases;
3. a network of individuals and organizations working with geographic data in humanities disciplines (history, language and literary studies, archaeology, etc.), and cultural heritage (galleries, libraries, archives and museums).
