Pelagios is a long-running initiative that links information online through common references to places. 
To create and maintain these connections requires agreed methodologies, user-friendly tools and a community of practice.

Pelagios restricts its scope to the geographic aspects of data, and semantic annotation - i.e. associating every reference to a place within
the data to an entry in a globally accessible gazetteer - as a mechanism for achieving it.
Pelagios provides:
1. a method for creating semantic annotations, based on the W3C Web Annotation standard;
2. tools and specifications for creating and making use of these annotations, most notably Recogito, an open-source platform for geo-annotating texts, images and databases;
3. a network of individuals and organizations working with geographic data in humanities disciplines (history, language and literary studies, archaeology, etc.), and cultural heritage (galleries, libraries, archives and museums).
