<p>Pelagios is a formal network of equal and independent Partners who coordinate their work together. Each Partner defines a set of contributions it will make to one or more of the Activities.
There are no fees or subscriptions, and Partners remain in full control of their own work plans and resources.
Generally speaking, Partner contributions operate through independently-funded or voluntary projects.To become a Partner, individuals and 
institutions can jointly agree a set of contributions to one or more of the Activities with the Networkâ€™s governing Committee,
formalised through a Memorandum of Understanding. To discuss this with the Network, drop us a [line](mailto:commons@pelagios.org).
